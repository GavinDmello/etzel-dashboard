Dashboard for etzel server.

* **Ping -Pong with the server:** Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.
* **Get data from the server:** React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
* **push Data to the server:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

* **Graphically show the amount of data in the queue:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

* **Show the projects,queues:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
* **Delete the queue:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
* **Purge the queue:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
